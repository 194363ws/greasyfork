<%- description 'Rules and restrictions for code posted to Greasy Fork.' %>

<p>These are the requirements for scripts posted to Greasy Fork. These are intended to keep Greasy Fork a safe and useful place for user scripts.</p>

<p>This is very much a work in progress. <%=link_to 'Let us know what you think.', help_contact_path()%></p>

<ul>
	<li>Scripts must include a description of what they do and may not do things unreasonably outside of this description.</li>
	<li>Code posted to this site may not be obfuscated. It's important that users be given the opportunity to inspect and understand a script before installing it.</li>
	<li>Your script must respect others' copyrights. This includes the script itself and any resources (for example images) it uses. If you intend on using someone else's content, abide by their licensing terms or get their permission before doing so.</li>
	<li>Use of external code is limited. <%=link_to "Read more details on what's allowed.", help_external_scripts_path()%></li>
</ul>

<p>If you notice a script that falls outside of these parameters, please report it by going to the Feedback link for that script, starting a discussion, and choosing the "Report script" option.</p>
